Google Developer Interview Questions
====================================

**note**: Google (and other FANG companies) has different approach to interviews, which is based mostly on algorithmic and analytical skills (at least on the first stage). In this document, I'm collecting my basic tips, information and sample questions, which could be relevant during preparations process. Moreover, I also haven't passed this process (yet), but I participated in it.

**preferred programming languages to choose for the interview**: C, C++, Java, Python, Go (we should choose language from Google Tech Stack)

Coding interview topics
-----------------------
- **Data Structures**
  - Arrays + Matrices
  - Linked Lists
  - Queues + Stacks + Heaps
  - Sets + Hash Maps
  - Trees
  - Graphs
- **Algorithms**
  - Iteration + Recursion
  - Binary Search (in trees)
  - DFS + BFS (in graphs)
  - Sorting
  - Operations on Lists (e.g. reversing)
  - Operations on Strings (e.g. finding palindrome, anagram, substring, etc.)
  - Dynamic Programming (memoization, divide & conquer)
- **Analysis**
  - Time and space analysis
  - Big O notation
  - Design/Thinking about alternative solutions
- **Others**
  - Induction
  - Proofs
  - OOP and design
  - Multiple pointers
  - Sliding window
  - Greedy algorithms
  - Data Flow
  - Communication in the system
  - Software design patterns
  - Handling large amount of data -> e.g. processing data in chunks in parallel
  - Optimizing Solution

Where to learn/train coding?
----------------------------
- Learn Data Structures and Algorithms (books, university and on-line courses)
  - Coursera
  - Udacity
  - MIT Open courseware - Introduction to Algorithms
- Leet Code
- Hacker Rank
- Geeks for Geeks
- Kattis
- Interview Cake
- Top Coder
- Cracking Coding Interview Book

Preparation stages
------------------
- **Be experienced**
- **Know what you're doing**
- **Be smart**

### Be experienced
- Practice programming trasks
- Use multiple pointers
- Use frequency counting
- Do a lot of interviews
- Do mock interviews

### Know what you're doing
- Clarify the problem and input/output data
- Talk to the interviewer
- Description of the problem
- Sample data input/output
- Constraints
- Test your solution (e.g. via going through the steps of algorithm)
- Using whiteboard/shared screen
- Making visualisations
- Thinking out loud during the interview
- Asking questions
- Try to make coding part look trivial (e.g. by decomposing task)
- Tell what kind of approach/algorithm/data structures you want to apply
- Explain solution in plain English
- Explain everything step-by-step (in bullet points)
- Use pseudo-code
- write functions
- implement code
- go top-down (from the most abstract concept to the implementation details)
- solve task as fast as possible (not loose the time)

### Be smart
- Use creativity -> ask questions
- Self-awareness
- Consistency -> creating habits and solution strategy, doing tasks often
- Intensivity -> doing a lot of exercises
- Motivation

Sample tasks
------------
- find sub-string of a string
- verify if a given string is a palindrome
- verify if a given string containing different types of parenthesis is balanced
- Find path from point A to B in a maze
- reverse a linked list
- find two numbers on the list which equals to a given value
